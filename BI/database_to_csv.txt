To get local copies of the data warehouse tables you can connect to psql and create cv copies of each table
To do this, you will need to connect to pqsl using the following command:

    psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <user> -d <database> # these credentials can be found on the slack channel

You will then be prompted to enter a password to successfully connect to the remote database. 

Once you have connected to psql, you will need to run a command to copy tables to local csv files.
This will be in the format:
    \copy (SELECT * from <table_name>) to '<desired_file_location>' with csv header

for example:
    \copy (SELECT * from dim_staff) to 'BI\dim_staff.csv' with csv header

    \copy (SELECT * from dim_counterparty) to 'BI/dim_counterparty.csv' with csv header

If the copy has been successful, you will see a copy statement in the terminal followed by how many rows were successfully copied
    e.g 
        postgres=> \copy (SELECT * from dim_currency) to 'BI/dim_currency.csv' with csv header
        COPY 3

You should also be able to see the new csv files in your desired file location

You can use the command \q to exit psql
